                The program should return 0

1-alphabet.c --> Uses the print_alphabet() function to print the alphabets, in 
                 lowercase, followed by a new line

2-print_alphabet_x10.c --> Prints 10 times the alphabet in lowercase, followed
                           by a new line

11-print_to_98.c --> Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 
98, followed by a new line.

	-Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);

	-Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space

	-Numbers should be printed in order

	-The first printed number should be the number passed to your function

	-The last printed number should be 98

	-You are allowed to use the standard library
